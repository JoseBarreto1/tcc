	Biometrics, widely utilized in security systems, is known for its 
	reliability and finds applications in accessing bank accounts, 
	authenticating establishments, enabling mobile device payments, 
	and managing access control, among other uses. Facial recognition, 
	among the various biometric methods available, stands out due to 
	its practicality and extensive study and usage. Moreover, it can be 
	applied without the need for physical contact. In light of this 
	context, the present study aims to develop a facial recognition 
	prototype for access control. In this process, an ESP32-CAM board 
	was employed to execute facial recognition, complemented by an LCD 
	display to enhance user interaction with the prototype. In overall 
	terms, the prototype has met expectations, delivering a compact 
	and user-friendly hardware solution that facilitates real-time user 
	authentication.

Biometrics in security systems has been widely used due to its
reliability, and can be used to access bank accounts, authenticate
establishments, payment on mobile devices, access control, etc.
Among the available biometrics, facial recognition stands out for its
practicality and for being one of the most studied and used biometrics.
It can be applied without the need for physical contact. That said,
The present study aims to present the development of a prototype of
facial recognition for access control and authentication. For this purpose,
a Single Board Computer (SBC) will be used, represented by the device
ESP32-CAM, where he will be responsible for capturing and classifying the images in almost no time
real. These images being processed through facial detection algorithms
Open Source Computer Vision Library (OPENCV) and algorithms
of machine learning.

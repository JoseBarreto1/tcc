	Biometrics, in security systems, has been widely used due to its
	reliability, and can be used to access bank accounts, authentication of
	establishments, payment on mobile devices, access control, etc.
	Among the biometrics available, facial recognition stands out for its
	practicality and because it is one of the most studied and used biometrics.
	It can be applied without the need for physical contact. That said,
	The present study aims to develop a prototype of
	facial recognition for access control and authentication. For this purpose,
	an ESP32-CAM device will be used, which will be responsible for capturing and
	classify images in real time. These images are processed through
	of facial detection and recognition algorithms.

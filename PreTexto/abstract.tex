    Facial recognition is applied in various technologies such as cell phone unlocking, establishment authentication, means of payment for mobile applications and others. To improve confidence in security systems, facial recognition service has been increasingly used. Therefore, the present study aims to discuss the development of a facial recognition prototype, for access control and authentication. For this purpose, a Single Board Computer (SBC) will be used, represented by an ESP32-CAM device, which is responsible for capturing and classifying the images in real time, through face detection algorithms from the Open Source Computer Vision Library ( OPENVC) and machine learning algorithms.
